# tictactoe
A basic ASCII based TicTacToe rendition in c
It's exactly what it  sounds like. 
The objective of this project was to be familiar with the basic functions of c and use it for documentation exercises.
The code itself, as it is for the time, is fairly convoluted and unclean so attempts will be made to make it more ordered.
